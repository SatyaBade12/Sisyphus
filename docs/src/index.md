# Sisyphus

Sisyphus.jl is a high-performance library for gradient based quantum optimal control. It is well integrated into the existing Julia ecosystem by supporting definitions of quantum objects from the [QuantumOptics.jl](https://qojulia.org/) library, automatic differentiation through [Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/), and supported with [CommonSolve.jl](https://github.com/SciML/CommonSolve.jl) solver mechanism.
