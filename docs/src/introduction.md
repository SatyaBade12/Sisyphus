# Introduction

Pulse-level control is an essential component of today's quantum devices, and production of high-fidelity control protocols is necessary in the current search for quantum computational advantage. Both gradient-based and gradient-free quantum optimal control (QOC) methods have been developed, and many of them, like Krotov, GRAPE, GOAT, and CRAB are already included in popular frameworks like QuTiP and ...


Differentiable programming ($\partial P$) has recently become a trend..
The onset of a multitude of frameworks that support automatic differentiation like JAX in Python and Zygote in Julia...

Our programming language of choice is Julia due to its simplicity in representing complex mathematical structures and state of the art libraries which are on par with the best C++
implementations.
